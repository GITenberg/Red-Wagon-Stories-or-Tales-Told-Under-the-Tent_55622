<h2 id="THE_PRESS_AGENTS">THE PRESS AGENT’S STORY.</h2>

<p>The Press Agent of the Big
Show had formerly been dramatic
editor of the leading daily in Council
Bluffs. It was his star boast that he was
the only critic in the Middle West that
ever had the nerve to roast Joe Jefferson,
and he said he did it in the interest of
art.</p>

<p>“Art,” says he, “must be preserved, an’
the only way to do it is by knockin’.”</p>

<p>The Press Agent wore his hair long,
had a smooth face, and looked like a police
reporter out on a three-column story
with the facts coming in slowly. He
hadn’t much baggage, but he always carried
about a ream of adjective hit paper,
two lead pencils, and a pass-pad. No man
ever heard him talk without wondering
what kind of stuff he beat out on a typewriter.</p>

<p>The saw dust spreader was smoothing
out the ring for the night acts and the
rest of the gang were sitting around roasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the route when the Press Agent came
through the red curtains at the dressing
tent entrance picking his teeth with a
straw. He sat down on the box where
the Greaser Knife Thrower kept his keen
steels, and filling his pipe waited for a
break in the conversation. Then he asked
the gasoline man for a match. After he
got the fire he saw there were no words
loose from the ring-bankers, so he starts
his skein.</p>

<p>“Well, lads, we hit ’em up hard at the
mat today, 12,000 on the blue boards an’
the ticket wagon window down before the
harness is on for the entree. S’pose them
laddy-bucks in No. 2 car will say it was a
good billin’, but I’m tellin’ you people
that this is a readin’ community, an’ it
was the press work that had the coin
hittin’ the window this date, an’ that’s no
cold cream con, either. The Gov’nor
knows it, for he gives me a good word
an’ a back pat jus’ as the parade was
startin’ for the main highway.</p>

<p>“I’m given youse the real word, an’
it’s this&mdash;when you can get ’em readin’
about the Big Show you’ve already got
’em feelin’ for change to buy, an’ that’s
as true as ticker talk. The old man sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the paper that the Big Show will soon
be on the lot, an’ when he gets home to
daily bread he tells it to the old woman;
the kids get next and there’s no let up on
papa ’till he promises to buy in for the
whole family. An’ workin’ one is workin’
all&mdash;that’s my motto. It’s the press
work that gets ’em talkin’, an’ it’s the
talkin’ that’ll make ’em give up even
when wheat is down to 48 an’ interest on
mortgages is starin’ ’em in the face. Get
the paper talk an’ the money is so sure
that you can be plannin’ new acts for next
season before the first pasteboard hits
the bottom of the red box on the gate.</p>

<p>“But, say, it ain’t no children’s game
to get this paper talk. The good old
days when you could blow into the newspaper
offices with a loud vest and a tiger
claw hangin’ on your watch guard is
done. Them times the old agent would
lay down a cigar on the editor’s desk,
spread a lot of salve about the greatest
yet and the only one in captivity story,
and then work the gag ‘write me somethin’,
old man.’ But them days is strictly
past. It’s a new make up now, an’ a
new line of talk that wins ’em. You want
to enter quiet like just as if you were one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of them Sunday school boys with a write-up
on a rally in the church basement. The
editor gives you the size-up for this, an’
when you says ‘I’m ahead of the Big
Show comin’ 25th and 26th,’ he’s so surprised
that he’s glad to see you, an’ it’s
once aroun’ the track before the bunch
sees the flag that he asks you out to drink
before you spring your pass-pad. And,
if you don’t believe me, ask soft talking
Jim Jay Brady and have it passed off for
gospel.</p>

<p>“It’s the approach that makes the center
shot this new century. Go in easy, be
skimp with your talk, don’t spread the
salve too thick, an’ give ’em clean copy&mdash;that’s
the game; be you ahead of Henry
Irving with ten carloads of stuff, a dinky
little farce comedy with a society dame
doin’ the lead, a melodrama with a real
convict a-cracking the safe, or one of
them Broadway big ones&mdash;no matter, it’s
the same, an’ what goes for them goes
for the Big Show, whether you’ve got 68
cars on the sidin’, or you have slipped in
after night with rubber boots on&mdash;and
that’s no Tody Hamilton catch line.</p>

<p>“But you don’t want to be too certain;
you can get your chances in this line just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
as easy as in the shootin’ gallery when its
bullets against clay pipes. Some of the
boys that handles the copy for the Eastern
press can put up a frost that would keep
Chicago beef around the world in a sailin’
ship. But you can melt ’em if you
make good. Remember hittin’ Boston las’
season an’ runnin’ up against one of these
heady boys with a foldin’ forehead. I
give it to ’em easy, an’ when I says circus
he looks at me through his windows an’
says so haughty:</p>

<p>“‘Ah, the circus! Quite a diverting
entertainment. Originated with the
Greeks.’</p>

<p>“Now wouldn’t that make you itch?
Me mind gets to chasin’ ’roun’ for a proper
come-back, an’ I tries to recollect the
names of some of them old guys what
went paddlin’ ’roun’ in a sheet an’ sandals
spittin’ out wise words that no one
has forgot. An’ mem’ry lands me at the
right dock, so I han’s this to the college
boy:</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ sez I, ‘I believe it was Aristophanes
who wrote an epic on the circus
to be read at one of Nero’s spring openin’s.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“The words is hardly out of me mouth
when he gives me one of those looks that
would have made Peary thought he had
found the pole. So I lays me copy on
the desk and gives five bells to back water
an’ I’m in the elevator. An’ so help me
Bob, I hardly reaches the pavement before
I sees sheets of paper flutterin’ in
the air an’ me copy falls on the asphalt.
The college boy had lifted it. Now you
would think that it was a sheet that
roasted us. Not at all, not at all. He
gives us a two-column write-up and three
half tones that had me up to the bar an’
dizzy for a day. The worst will fool
you.</p>

<p>“An’, say, that reminds me. Remember
when we was playin’ the week’s run
in Chicago las’ July? Well, I’d been skatin’
roun’ to the papers an’ buyin’ drinks
for the press boys, an’ it was joggin’
along to three on the dials when I remembers
I have a bed at the hotel. It was out
near the lot, an’ I starts out to walk. I’m
crossin’ the railroad tracks when a weary
steps out an’ asks me for a match. I gives
up, when another comes into the talk an’
says, ‘Give us money.’ Say, I didn’t have
but thirty cents, an’ I gave up. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
highwaymen thought I was lyin’, an’ was
going to tap me when I says, ‘Now, boys,
let’s argue this out.’ So I takes them two
Jesse Jameses under a lamp post an’ gives
them a josh talk on the Big Show that has
’em serfy.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Boss Canvasman, who
was always interested when there was any
fight talk, “what happened, what happened?”</p>

<p>“What happened?” says the Press
Agent. “Hear me! I takes out me pass-pad
an’ writes passes for them robbers
until a policeman comes, when I turns ’em
over. An’ that ain’t all; I gets a column
story in each of the afternoon sheets on
how the Press Agent of the Big Show
captures two bold boys, an’ the Gov’nor
gives me the good word and a double X,
an’ I says thankee an’ repeats me motto,
‘An’ workin’ one is workin’ all,’ to every
barkeeper that was sellin’ after midnight
that evenin’.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_OLD_GRAFTERS">THE OLD GRAFTER’S LAMENT.</h2>

<p>The Old Grafter had corns on
his knuckles from holding greenbacks
between his fingers.</p>

<p>He looked a trifle seedy about the costume,
but his moustache was waxed&mdash;the
moustache, too, was dyed and you saw
the reason when he took his hat off. The
Old Grafter wore a celluloid collar and a
polka dotted dickey, and when his vest
was opened it showed up the shyness of
his linen.</p>

<p>The Concert Manager was springing
gossip about the principal clown who was
having trouble with his wife who did the
iron jaw swing. He saw the Old Grafter
coming across the ring and he stopped,
for it was pretty well known that old-timer
wouldn’t stand for scandal. The
Old Grafter bit off enough tobacco from
the canvasman’s plug to make a comfortable
quid and then sat down on the snake
box. He was looking sad and there was
silence. Presently he sent a splash of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
juice up against the center pole and after
shifting the quid he opened up.</p>

<p>“Say fellers, I’ve been cuttin’ the cards
since John Robinson had money in tent
shows an’ I’ve come to the verdict, it’s
this&mdash;when you’ve got the green in your
pocket an’ the suckers is tipped off they’ll
crowd you as thick as flies on the popcorn
pile, but when there ain’t no coin
to jingle you kin get so lonesome that
you’ll go to bed with a hot water bot’l for
company.”</p>

<p>This bit of wisdom impressed the gang,
for no one spoke, and the Old Grafter
threw his reversing bar and chinned out
this&mdash;</p>

<p>“The old days is gone an’ they’s left
the circus graft on a weedy sidin’ with
no roun’ trips back to the lan’ of promise.
Them was the one ring days an’ in
them times there was allus fodder for the
hogs. Today it’s one ring, two rings,
three rings and a stage&mdash;the biggest tent
on earth, but for the grafter&mdash;nothin’,
nothin’. Me, what use to turn the shank
of the week with a bigger wad than the
principal bareback gets, me makes today
a dirty twenty on percentage an’ sellin’
reserved seats. I’m ashamed to look the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
old days in the face. Why say in them
days many a time the proprietor of the
Big Show was touchin’ the grafter for
cash when business was bad an’ today so
diff’rent, so diff’rent&mdash;if I gets into a
poker play on the train an’ the ante’s a
nickel I’ve got to reach twice to find the
coin. If I’d had the good sense what’s in
Bill McGinnis head I’d a bought a little
road tavern like he did twenty years ago
an’ I’d a-had a bank book roostin’ back
of the bar. But I thinks there’s still somethin’
doin’ my end an’ I waits an’ loses&mdash;and
what do I get&mdash;a couple of treasuries
and some change at the pay off durin’
the season with crackers and cheese for
me an’ the old woman in the winter. It’s
the diff’rence ’tween horse radish an’ saw
dust an’ its got me slippin’ back.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you fellers somethin’ ’bout the
old days. ’Twas ’bout ’76 an’ we was
graftin’ with a one ring outfit. We struck
good crops and sunny weather in the one
nighters in the Ohio valley. The farmers
had money an’ there was peaches in
the orchard for every boy with the troup
that had a bag of tricks. Everybody was
standin’ in on the graft an’ we had a fixer
two days ahead so there’d be no call. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was carryin’ a car with the lay out an’
four tin horns that was science on faro
and turnin’ the wheel. The big game was
invited to the car an’ there was allus a
set out an’ sumthin’ to drink. The little
fish was worked on the lot an’ there was
days, many days when the graft was
mor’n the ticket wagon count up, an’ the
rake off was loafin’ ’bout par, continuous.
Good days them, me boys, for ev’ry body
from the boss of the outfit down to the
stake driver. Money was comin’ easy an’
when there was any protestin’ on the part
of the patrons an’ it got to fists, or gun
play we passed along the Hey Rube an’
there was Gettysburg till mornin’ if they
was lookin’ for battle.</p>

<p>“The best burg we hit was a lit’l settlement
where we had a two mile haul up
the pike from track to lot. Everything
was ripe for graftin’ an’ we was ready
for harvest. Seems like a reform committee
had to hit down all the games and
the folks was hungry for gamlin’. The
posters in No. 1 car piped us off
on conditions an’ it was said that them
paste spreaders traveled off with a roll
from stud polker in the car after the bills
was on the stands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“They wuz on the lots waitin’ for us
when the boss landed to lay off the pitch
for the round top, we wuz only usin’ one
then an’ had no an’mals to speak of. The
fakirs got in the game early an’ transparent
cards from gay Paree was the first
bait and bitin’ was good. ’Fore the parade
started all hands was busy on the
lot takin’ care of the games an’ say the
farmers had it with ’em in rolls. The
foxy boy in the ticket wagon has all his
bad coin ready and the constable with the
badge has been fixed with a ten to see
there’s no argument when short change
is handed out.</p>

<p>“Oh! we worked systematic them days.</p>

<p>“Well, say, before the band had struck
up the grand march for the entree gold
bricks wuz sellin’ like cod fish cakes at a
nigger camp meetin’ an’ the boys what
was workin’ the shells had to lay off to
get the stiffness out’er their fingers.</p>

<p>“I hates to tell it, I hates to tell it in
the days there’s nothing’ doin’.</p>

<p>“You see I was cappin’ for the boss of
the show an’ say that day keeps me busier
than a man drivin’ sheep. The outfit was
gettin’ thirty-five per cent. of the graft an’
if the partic’lar grafter who was gettin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the coin failed to come up we se’ed that
he was prop’ly turned over to the off’cers
of the law an’ we did the prosecutin’ on
the groun’ that we was runnin’ a strictly
moral show. Say, while I was watchin’,
a farmer with a bunch of weeds under his
chin an’ a face like a quince comes up to
me an’ makes a holler. Somebody had
touched him for his wad ’fore he could
get to the games an’ he was dead sore. I
se’ed that he was goin’ to make trouble
so I remembers that his wagon is standin’
in the dirt road by the lot. I gives a
stakeman the tip he kicks the off bay in
the flanks an’ there’s a runaway. The
corn cutter chases after his team an’ forgits
that he ever had a roll.</p>

<p>“An’ say at night down in the car the
air was hot. The tin horns was busy and
coin was droppin’ like rotten apples in a
mill race. The boys what was dealin’ the
faro had monkeyed with the deck an’ it
was far to the bad for the spenders. ’Bout
time to start haulin’ for the cars two burly
boys begins to talk fight an’ it looks
like Hey Rube all aroun’. One sticks his
knuckles into me face an’ I says to him
sort’er fierce like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, young fellow, if youse lookin’ for
fight I’ll git one of the boys to stick his
teeth in your neck an’ you’ll change your
mind.</p>

<p>“There was no gun playin’ but there
was a lot of chinnin’ and cussin’ but we
finally gets the tin horns out an’ starts ’em
up the road to the first section. The gang
is hot after us an’ there was only one
thing saved us. Jes’ as the crowd was
closin’ in I sees the tiger den with the two
blacks pullin’ it comin’ over the hill. I
chases forward to the trainer an’ when
the cage gits up close we jes’ shoves them
two tin horn dealers in the den with the
tigers an’ saves their lives.”</p>

<p>“Never could make a return date there,
could you, Bill?” asked the Boss Canvasman
as he made one of the spotted coach
dogs take a jump through his hands.</p>

<p>“Return date, well I should reckon.
Went back there in two months an’ still
foun’ ’em ripe. But there was only one
way to do it. The Boss had to paint over
all the cars an’ wagons an’ change the
name of the show. The hay boys thought
it was a new outfit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_BILL_POSTERS_VISIT">THE BILL POSTER’S VISIT.</h2>

<p>The Bill Poster was a stranger
to most every one in the outfit.
He traveled a month ahead of the
show on Advertising Car No. 2, and
while he hung around during the run in
New York he never got well enough
acquainted to mix in with the ring bank
squatters. While the outfit had great
respect for him, and especially for his
work, he wasn’t generally understood,
and this did not keep his popularity up
to par. He always seemed solid with the
business staff and called the assistant
treasurer by his first name, and these
two conditions were known to the sawdust
boys. They always took off their
hats to anybody on the staff, and the man
in the ticket wagon was only known at
the pay-off. Then, too, he dressed well
and wore a diamond, that is, a real
one, and altogether his financial condition
was too good.</p>

<p>But for some reason or other the Bill
Poster did happen back on the show one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
afternoon. Just after the matinee, when
the gang sat down on the bank for the
spiel, he was seen walking across the
track, and the boys at once began to
speculate on what brought the paste
spreader back to home. Some of them
thought it was for a call-down, and the
concert manager declared that was the
cause, for, said he, “I never seen a town
billed so rotten as this un.” But the gasoline
man, who was a close observer,
thought different. He knew that there
was a little fairy working in the Fall of
Rome ballet that was sweet on the paste
boy, and he put the rest of the crowd
wise before the conversation got too far
from the shore.</p>

<p>“Cert’nly,” he said. “Didn’t I see the
guy in his plaid rags ev’ry night when he
was playin’ the Garden, gittin’ the little
lady at the dressin’ room door and blowin’
her off to butter cakes an’ coffee before
she chases to the bridge an’ home.”</p>

<p>The gasoline man was getting real gabby
on the love affair, when the Bill Poster
came through the red curtains over the
dressing tent entrance and walked across
the ring to where the gang sat in the
shadows. He had a sassy little “Howdy”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for everybody and then passed around a
box of Turkish cigarettes. Everybody
passed it up, and the Boss Canvasman bit
off a two-by-three chew from his plug
and looked sour.</p>

<p>“Slipped back to see the Boss,” said the
Bill Poster, as he lighted one of the Turkish
boys with a match he took out of a
sterling box that had a beer ad. on it.
“Ain’t no secret; I want a transfer. I’m
good an’ tired of the slow work on No.
2 car, an’ so I gets a day off an’ runs back
to see if the Boss won’t put me with the
opposition crew.”</p>

<p>The gang was silent. Nobody had
asked for the why, so nobody commented
on it. The fact that he was going to have
nerve enough to ask to get in the opposition
crew filled the concert manager with
disgust, for he knew something about bill
posting, and also knew that it took a
triple-plated crackerjack to hold a place
with this crowd of rush pasters of a
three-ring outfit.</p>

<p>“There’s nothin’ to it,” continued the
Bill Poster, “gettin’ into a town where
ev’rything is dead ready, all the boards
up, and nothing to do but paste. I want
a little excitement. I allus gets it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
winter, when I’m billin’ a hall show.
Many a time I’ve laid me bundle of lithos
under a doorstep to punch some guy who
was tearin’ down my stuff in saloons
where I’d spent up me money, and then
hangin’ his stuff in the window. I tell
you the opposition crew is the crowd to
have the ginger. When your car is
hangin’ up on a grassy sidin’ an’ you gits
a wire that the other show is routin’ three
days ahead of your own bookin’s, it
makes you jump. The boss wires the
head of the gang to jump for the town
and beat ’em up. Beat ’em out, but
on the level, legitimate&mdash;but beat ’em
up. Don’t tear down none of their
billin’, but kill it if you have to buy the
side of the Presbyterian meetin’ house to
git a showin’ for them nine-colored
twenty-eight sheet stands.”</p>

<p>As far as the gang on the bank was
concerned, the Bill Poster was talking
Greek, and he had ’em wingin’. The
Concert Manager thought he was “next,”
but his coupling broke before his understanding
left the city limits. Just then
the Press Agent of the Big Show happened
in and the talk hadn’t gone three
lengths before the Bill Poster and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
newspaper man crossed bayonets. Both
were doing the publicity gag, and both
had a well set and riveted idea that each
one and not the other was bringing the
people into the tent and giving the show
a good gate to send back on the statement
to the high hat boys in the city who
were doing the financing.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you something,” said the
Press Agent, as serious as if he was
arguing to get a half column write-up on
fourteen dollars’ worth of advertising in
the only daily in the town. “Let me tell
you. These days the people who are
spending money for amusements reads
the papers, and it’s the paper talk that
lands the coin at the window. I know
what I’m talkin’ about. Bill posting is
all right, but it’s the newspaper work that
does the real singin’.”</p>

<p>“Come off!” said the Bill Poster.
“You’re only pluggin’ your own job.
You don’t mean to tell me that the boss
of this outfit would keep all the printin’
shops in Cincinnatty goin’ night an’ day
to git out the wall stuff if they didn’t
think it was some good. An’ say, they
wouldn’t be runnin’ three billin’ cars
ahead of this here show if there wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
some come-back to the money they was
blowin’. Why, say, what do you think
they are? Your press work is all right,
an’ my bill postin’ is all right, an’ you’ve
got to have both.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you’re right,” said the
Press Agent; “I guess they use the billing
to emphasize my work.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know so sure what you means,
partner,” said the Bill Poster, “but the
Boss of our car figgers it out this way:
He says that the readin’ in the papers
about the big show makes ’em look at the
pictures on the wall. And, says he, the
pictures on the wall makes ’em read what
is in the papers. An’, say, he’s been pastin’
since the John Robinson days.”</p>

<p>“Guess he’s right,” said the Press
Agent.</p>

<p>This last statement hit the gang as real
good sense, and they half agreed that the
Bill Poster knew something about his
business.</p>

<p>“I tell you, boys,” continued the Bill
Poster, as he took a seat on the sawdust
pile and lighted another one of the Sultan’s
dreams, “in me dull moments, when
we is travelin’ an’ there’s nothin’ to do
but layin’ out paper an’ gittin’ the buckets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ready, I figgers it out this way: You can
git ’em with the paper talk all right; but
there’s one thing you can do with good
bill postin’ and litho work, an’ it’s this,
you can’t make ’em read the papers, but
bless me, you can make ’em see bill postin’.
Say, me an’ the gang I work with in
New York have sniped the subway fence
so hard with red-on-yellows that you
would think there was nothing else on
Broadway. Did you see ’em? Well, you
bet. There was so much color stickin’
along the ditch that it hurt your eyes
when you rode by in a car. That’s what
I claims for proper billin’. You can git
it where they’ve got to see it.</p>

<p>“Say, to prove what I says is right, I’ll
tell you a little experience I has. I was
doin’ the litho work for a cheap price
house that was playin’ the old favorites
with a stock. They puts on ‘The White
Squadron.’ The boss comes to me and
says, ‘Look here, Jim, I wants you to do
your best with this piece; its costin’ us
a lot of money to get it on, and we wants
to get it back. There’s a diamond stud
coming to you if you gets what I calls a
good showin’.’ Say, I would ’a’ done it
anyhow for them kind words, but I says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I’ll git that diamond if I puts bills all over
the trees in Central Park an’ goes up in
stripes for ten years for doin’ it. I was
thinkin’ all the time some new gag to
work, when one mornin’ comin’ down I
reads that there’s a yacht race in Harlem
river that afternoon. You know, boys,
‘The White Squadron’ is one of them
naval pieces, an’ has a lot of ships in it.
Well, the Sunday before I’d pasted up
a lot of one an’ a half sheet boards with
type an’ litho stuff, an’ I has it loaded in
a wagon ready to git out on the street
some night and sit the boards in doorways.
But no, says I. Me partner an’
I drives the team out to the Harlem River
bridge. The river is so thick with tugs
and launches full of people to see the
boat race that you can hardly find the
water. We waits until the race starts, an’
then we clumps them boards into the river,
carefully like, so they will fall with the
picture side up. They hits the current
and starts floatin’ down. They all seems
to cling together, and make a big raft, an’
all you can see is ‘White Squadron.’
Everybody on the bridge and the boats is
a readin’ and laughin’, and we knows it’s
the showin’ of our lives. And say, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
boards keeps on driftin’ wid the current
an’ gits so thick that when the guys in
the paper boats hits that part of the river
they gits stuck and the race has to be
called off.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Press Agent, coolly,
“did the show do any business?”</p>

<p>“Business!” replies the Bill Poster;
“you’d a thought there was a fire in the
neighborhood ev’ry night, the crowd was
there so thick fightin’ to git in. An’ say,
the guys what got broke up in the boat
race is so stuck on the joke that they gives
a theatre party an’ the papers is full of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Press Agent, “and it
took the press agent to get that in the
papers.”</p>

<p>“But the bill posters got ’em in the
house,” retorted the Bill Poster, with the
air of a man who had knocked the local
welterweight over the ropes.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CANDY_BUTCHERS">THE CANDY BUTCHER’S DREAM OF LOVE.</h2>

<p>It was generally conceded that the
Candy Butcher was the handsomest
man in the outfit. To be sure,
the gent who did the sixty-one horse
act in Ring Three was a Charlie boy for
good looks, but it was only when he was
in the red coat and working. When he
left the dressing tent and went red light
hunting in a one night stand he looked
like a canvasman on a visit home to his
people, but he was a hot card when he
had the dicer on in the horse act. It was
so different with the Candy Butcher&mdash;he
was always dressed up and he never
looked like he felt it.</p>

<p>No one ever saw the Candy Butcher
wear a coat, but his checked trousers were
always creased whether the big show was
playing a one night in Keokuk or doing
a run in the Madison Square Garden over
in the hot city. And he always wore a
vest, but it was never buttoned and there
was a red striped shirt with one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Montana boys screwed in the bosom right
under the dickey dot of a bow. The vest
was something to speak about&mdash;it had the
band wagon way to the bad on the distribution
of colors and looked like page
89 in a wall paper drummer’s sample
book. There was a shiny chain with an
elk’s tooth and a tiger’s claw and in one
vest pocket was a date book with a tooth
brush and a blue pencil doing a duet on
the other side of the rainbow. The
Candy Butcher always wore pink underwear
and had his sleeves rolls up to his
elbows. And you don’t want to forget
the little miniature of “blondy” that he
had pinned right over his blood pump.</p>

<p>And as a matter of detail the Candy
Butcher always had this get up the whole
season and no grease spots ever scored&mdash;he
was just the same whether it was
back of the tub and the peanuts giving
the “five tonight good people” gag, selling
concert tickets during the run-offs
in the hippodrome or Sunday afternoon
in the ladies’ coach, section three, telling
the big blonde who did the cloud swing in
the round top rigging that of all the girls
she was the onliest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The gang was sitting on a carpet roll
under the big top when the Candy Butcher
came across the track and sat down on
the ring bank. He was looking sad, but
his pants were creased and the Montana
boy was shining like a frozen hunk of
Kennebec water. He rolled himself a
cigarette and the gang being silent he
edged in with this bunch of talk:</p>

<p>“I’m bluer this evenin’ than the paste
boards they’re passin’ out of the ticket
wagon an’ if it wasn’t for gettin’ the dock
at the pay off I’d be up against some
boozery workin’ the syphon like an engine
at a tenement fire. I ain’t got no
life in me ’t all an’ I won’t have until
we leaves the east an’ strikes the west
country. B’lieve me, me boys, the east
is all right for business, for I can pass
out the sour juice at five a throw right
here as well as any where, but it’s myself
an’ not the place. It was too much of
a feather bed las’ season an’ I was fool
enough not to remember that I had to
wake up. There ain’t no use talkin’, whenever
a guy gets a good dream in this here
life some sucker has got to give him the
alarm clock finish an’ he wakes up with a
yell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, I can call the turn on the folks on
the blue boards an’ have ’em all drinkin’
lemon juice and shellin’ peanuts an’ I
likes to do it, but me heart ain’t in the
work, this season and that’s no lithograph
josh either. I’ll tell you and some of
youse may give me the grin, but it’s ten
to one you’ve had the soft spot yourselves,
so I ain’t a-carin’. Remember the Congress
of Nations gag they was workin’
las’ season? Well right back of me lay
out there was a lot of maidens that was
doin’ the gypsy village and fakin’ a lot of
beads and fortune tellin’. There was one
little fairy in the outfit that had me dead,
an’ I don’t mind tellin’ you that she had
me soft from the start. She wasn’t none
of these city pick ups but a nice little gal
that talked quiet and minded her own.
She didn’t mix with the rest of the push
an’ we got thick the first day the canvass
went up. She tells me her story confidential
like an’ I give her me sympathy,
for her people was dead agin her for
troopin’. You see she had been working
in a New York hash house, where they
had Bible talk on the wall an’ where they
gave a splash of beans and a draw for a
dime. She gets tired an’ a guy what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
been eatin’ at the place gives her a job
in a boardin’ house waitin’ on the table.
Here she meets the man what has the
Congress get up to put on an’ he tells her
gilt edge stories about the circus business
and to cut the talk down she joins out
with the show. Well, say, she was the
real thing to me. In two months she had
me stoppin’ the booze an sendin’ money
home to the folks, an’ it was a center shot
to get that out of me. She was allus
lookin’ for a chance to do me somethin’
kind an’ one day she did a little turn that
I wont forget long after I’ve past the
old man’ home.</p>

<p>“We had struck a rough run of one
nighters in Ohio and was looking for
bright things across the river in the West
Virginney townships. I had to do the
German Emperor in the parade an’ when
we got back to the lot I begins to get me
stand ready for the sale. I’d packed
up careful on the last stand and thought
it was sunny for the next. But when I
got me chest open I finds the citric acid
jug missing, and the floaters I’d saved to
throw on the top of the tub was gone too.
I had a cussin’ spell for a brief and then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
goes on a still hunt for lemons&mdash;the real
yellow. But bless me I couldn’t find one
in the village an’ there was nothin’ doin’
with the barkeeper what had ’em. Comin’
back I see’s a dago doin’ the shaker across
from the lot. He has ’bout a dozen
lemons and I offers him a good price, but
the brown boy wouldn’t sell an’ I was
sorer than a doped lion. I goes into the
tent and meets Maggie, that was the
name of me fairy, an’ she was sewin’ silvers
on her little coat. She sees me sad
like an’ I unloads me woes. The gal
didn’t say much, but she rubs her hand
across me frowner an’ sez, never mind,
John, I’ll help ye out, an’ goes ’way.
Say, youse may give me the laugh, but
durn me if that lass didn’t come back in
’bout an hour carryin’ a bucket an’ I
mos’ had a fit when I see’s it full of
gooseberries? What’s the game? sez I.</p>

<p>“Watch me?” sez Maggie, “an’ I’ll
keep you in the business.”</p>

<p>“Durn me, boys, if that little maiden
didn’t mash them berries to a pulp, strain
’em through the Hoochie Coochie gal’s
veil and have the tub full of sour juice
in seven minutes. I pours in the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
finds me floaters and puts them on the
ice bank an’ before the gang is passin’
once ’roun’ I’m sellin’ the juice as if
lemons was growin’ on locust trees.
Gooseberries too an’ the yaps couldn’t git
enough of it. It was better than any
graft ever in the one ring days an’ the
little gal had done it all. Ain’t no use
tellin’ you that I gives her a new shirt
waist an’ she gives me a squeeze that
makes me top spin like a merry-go-round.</p>

<p>“An’ say I fixed that dago that wouldn’t
give up. I tipped off one of the drivers
and when the first pole wagon leaves the
lot with the eight grays a pullin’ it, the
leads shies into the shaker stand an’ gives
it the apple cart finish.</p>

<p>“But the little fairy I lost her an’ that’s
why I’m sad. It was this way. The gal
what did the twistin’ for the Turks had
the fever an’ they shipped her home. The
guy what had the Congress comes to
Maggie, gives her the jersey and the
gauzy pants and sez she must do the part.
Maggie kicked an’ said she was engaged
for the gypsie village. The guy says “not
at all” and Maggie pulls off the spangles
an’ goes home. An’ say I ain’t been right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
since, an’ some days I feels like playin’
quits myself.”</p>

<p>The gang looked at the Candy Butcher
consolingly, but no one spoke.</p>

<p>“The las’ I hears from her,” she said,
“she had gone back to waitin’.” She’s
slingin’ hash in a Brooklyn Caf’, but I
loves her just as hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_BOSS_CANVASMANS">THE BOSS CANVASMAN’S YARN.</h2>

<p>The Boss Canvasman was always
sad. He never talked&mdash;he
just chewed his tobacco and worked.
Like the Candy Butcher, he never
wore a coat, but he cut the pink underwear
the Lemonade Boy flashed when he
had his sleeves rolled up at the tub. Of
course, the Boss had a coat, one that had
run through a dozen seasons, but he always
kept it strapped down under the
driver’s cushion on the pole wagon.
Whenever he did use it, the coat was doing
duty for a pillow when the last section
was late pulling out, and he was
sleeping on a gondola with the wall poles
for a mat.</p>

<p>The Boss Canvasman’s pants were ancient
history, and his vest was always
open. He wore one of those motorman
watches, with a shoestring for a chain.
He never looked at the watch except at
night, for when it was daytime he could
pull off the hour on the second by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
slant of the shadows across the big “top.”
The Boss never wore a collar. On Sunday
he would put a gold button in the
shirt band, lean disconsolately against the
tongue of the pole wagon, and feel uncomfortable
because he was dressed up.</p>

<p>There was no coin and jewel flash
about the Boss Canvasman. But he did
wear a rusty button in the lapel of his
vest&mdash;one of those G. A. R. things.
Across his face there was a long red scar,
and sometimes when he had been drinking
he talked about the first Ohio Cavalry&mdash;Gettysburg
was the answer. He feared
nobody nor anything. He had no friends,
except probably the Stock Boss, and there
was a tie there, because the two had done
the wagon show long years back before
three rings were dreamed of and farmers
were living on their own hog meat and
were happy. If he ever did talk, it was
when something went wrong, and then
his line of words were unfit for publication&mdash;even
in a Chicago weekly.</p>

<p>It looked like a squall just as the
matinee was breaking, and the boys at the
cages were hurrying the people along to
get the tent clear before the water fell.
The Boss Canvasman was hard at it getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the guys tight and throwing in cinders
around the big poles, where the dirt
was soft. He was taking no chances on
a blow. He had been mixed up in several
of those wind things down in Texas,
where a cyclone struck the lot, and all
that was left when the sun got back was
the ticket wagon and the elephants that
were chained to earth. He knew his
game.</p>

<p>After the usual beef stew and the
splash of beans had been put away with
a cup of black in the meal tent, the gang
gathered about the rink bank for a little
rest. The Sawdust Spreader and the
Gasoline Man were talking scandal, as
usual. This time it was the Snake
Charmer, who mixed it too strong with
the bottles on the last stand, lost the keys
to her snake-box and two boas and a
black boy starved to death before the
feeders could get the rabbits under the
fangs.</p>

<p>The gang sat down in silence until the
Concert Manager cut in with some
weather talk. It looked stormy, and as it
was the last night of the stand and a long
haul to the cars, everybody was feeling a
little sore. With a storm coming up, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
tent to watch, and then the haul and an
eight-hour jump with a hustle for the
march in spangles down the highway the
next morning. It had everybody grouchy
and thinking about hall shows with a roof
and a stove.</p>

<p>“Youse is doing a lot of guff about a
rain,” cut in the Side Show Spieler, as
he polished up his shiny brim on the corner
of the leaping tick, “but youse kin
stay inside when its droppin’, but for me&mdash;the
open and still the same old gab for
the dimes.”</p>

<p>The Boss Canvasman came up along
the ring bank, and without noticing the
crowd on the sawdust began to jamb
down the cinders around the net-pole
with the heel of his boot. From the distance
came a low rumble of thunder.
The gang looked at each other. Everybody
in the outfit feared a storm; not so
much for the storm itself, but for the
effect it had on the Boss Canvasman. He
never talked, but when the basses under
the hills were growling and the lightning
was doing a fancy jig against the
blue, he let loose a vocabulary that would
put a canalboat captain to the blush of
shame and send a sea-soaked old jib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
reefer to flight as a down and out cusser
beyond appeal, cards torn up, tables
turned over and police at the door. He
used the same two-em words, but the way
they hit the air would have made holes
in a battleship.</p>

<p>The broadcloth boys, who came over
in the sailing ships and scared the Indians
into religion by telling them how warm
it was in perdition, couldn’t touch the
Boss Canvasman for a scare when he got
on the same topic. He had a way of saying
“hell!” that made you want to turn
in a fire alarm just for personal comfort.</p>

<p>Presently he came across to the gang,
and to the surprise of all the rink-bank
squatters loosened up.</p>

<p>“Talkin’ ’bout workin’ in the rain, is
you?” he said, with a sneer, and a cross-hook
glance at the Side Show Spieler.
“You’ve got no kick. Say, you’ll have
your head on some Mamie’s shoulder in
the last day coach, up an’ away, while me
an’ my gang is still workin’ on this lot
gittin’ this round top on the wagon without
streakin’ her wid mud.”</p>

<p>There was not a reply, for the boys
knew he was right. The Side Show
Spieler hung around a bit, and, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
typhoid smile, remarked that he guessed
he’d bow hisself out, and more than that,
he did.</p>

<p>“Speakin’ about storms,” said the Boss
Canvasman, as he tied a long, running
knot in the guy that held the triple bars,
“I guess you fellows ’ceptin’ some of the
old boys, dunno what it is for a rain an’
a blow. I dun bin circusin’ it for forty
year, and, say, I’ve met some blows an’
lightnin’ that no sailor chap ain’t hit, I
don’t care how often he’s bin ’round the
Horn.”</p>

<p>You couldn’t have looked into the face
of that old fellow without believing every
word. He was burned brown by every
clime, creased and seamed by every frost,
and parched and dryed by every wind, and
his hands for knots and gnarls had an old
oak twice around the track and then past
the judges and turf writers, all off and
back to the street cars.</p>

<p>“Say, I’m going to tell you fellers sumthin’,”
said the Boss, as he sat down and
began twisting together a piece of rope
that was getting to look like a lion’s tail.
The gang was startled, for in the memory
of none there never lodged the fact that
the Boss Canvasman had been seen to sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
down as long as the pole was standing.
But he did, and what’s more, he reeled off
a yarn.</p>

<p>“Jes, ’fore the war broke out,” he said,
“I had enlisted in the First Ohio, I was
workin’ down the Valley of Virginia wid
a little wagon show doin’ the same kind
of work I’se doin’ now, ’cept it was nothin’
but play to this. Funny, too, for six
months afore I was down that same valley
wid the cavalry cuttin’ into them rebs, an’
I don’t mind telling you they was a cuttin’
us, too, wid Mosby in the woods an’
‘Stonewall’ Jackson, God knows where.</p>

<p>“Well, we had been doin’ a day an’ a
night stand in one of the little towns, an’
had a fourteen mile haul down the pike
for the next. We was hopin’ for a moon,
not so much to strike by, but for the drive,
for the people hadn’t got the roads to
right, an’ they was still full of artillery
ruts an’ wagon train wrecks. But we
pulled off the show, an’ before the last
bareback was on I has the menagerie canvas
on the wagons, all stakes up and the
dens down the road, with the boys leadin’
the elephants and the two camels over the
hills. It had been squally like, all night,
but I had the round top tightened up so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
hard that youse could have walked the
ropes an’ there was no danger.</p>

<p>“But jes’ as Dutch Andy was playin’
his last piece there was a bust of wind an’
a flash of lightnin’, an’ she began to come
down in solid sheets. We gets the people
out and gets to work on the tent wall.
This peels off in a jiffy, an’ the rain lets
up. Then down wid the big top an’ on
the wagon. But sumthin’ catches in the
riggin’ on the main pole, an’ I sees I has
to send me helper up on a climb to get her
clear. Everything was gone but the pole
wagon and a few side show things, an’
the ’bus we bosses rode in, with four
grays pullin’ it. Afore I sends my helper,
Jim, a fine boy, what had been a sailor,
up the pole, I send four men out to hold
her up by hangin’ on the long rope to the
far stake. Jim skins up to the top an’ gits
her loose, but before he kin git down the
gang holdin’ the long guy loses their holt,
an’ the pole falls.</p>

<p>“Well, we picks up Jim, an’ he is pretty
bad. Ribs in, an’ a lot of cuts. We tried
ev’ry house aroun’, but no doctor, though
there was one good old lady who gave us
some arnicy and strips of bandage she
said she’d kept to use on her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
when he got shot up in the Saturday night
fights ’bout the tavern. So we piles poor
Jim into the ’bus, and drives off easy,
while we walks along quiet like an’ sore.
Poor Jim, he jes’ groans an’ talks ’bout
doin’ his best, an’ I keeps givin’ him
liquor to make him forget it.</p>

<p>“But it was all over for Jim, an’ we
jes pullin’ out of a clump of woods down
by a river when we sees he’s dead. There
was no use carryin’ his body long, an’ he
didn’t have no people to ship it to, so we
decided to give him a decent burial. Two
of the stakemen digs the place, an’ we
lays poor Jim away under a willow tree.
Jes’ then one of the boys speaks up an’
sez:</p>

<p>“‘Say, boys, it don’t seem right to plant
Jim without sayin’ sumthin’.’</p>

<p>“But there wasn’t a mother’s son in
the crowd knew what to say, though they
is all on to what the fellow means. We
waits awhile an’ I sez:</p>

<p>“‘Well, there might be a little singin’.’</p>

<p>“An’ I wishes that I had the principal
clown there, for he was good on sad
songs, ’specially if he’d been boozin’ a
little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Might git the band,’ sez one of the
boys.</p>

<p>“‘But the band is way ahead.’ We is
all studyin’ like, when over the hills comes
the whistling wagon.</p>

<p>“‘Here is the calliope,’ sez one of the
stakemen.</p>

<p>“So we stops it, and ‘Reddy’ Cavenaugh,
who played the whistles, besides
doublin’ for Peter the Great in the street
parade, sez he has enough steam on to
play a little. We backs the calliope around,
an’ three of the boys holds the hosses.
Then Reddy played soft like, jes’ as soft
as he could, on the whistles, an’ we all
lifts our hats.”</p>

<p>“What did he play?” asked the Candy
Butcher, as he wiped away a tear with
his red cuff.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Boss Canvasman, “he
only knowed two tunes, ‘When Johnny
Comes Marchin’ Home’ and ‘The Blue
Danube,’ but we planted Jim to both.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_SIDE_SHOW_SPIELER">THE SIDE SHOW SPIELER SPEAKS.</h2>

<p>The Side Show Spieler was
a tall dark man with a sad face.
He was clean shaven, wore his
hair slightly long and looked like William
Jennings Bryan, after the vote was in and
counted and the telegraph operators had
gone home. He had a deep baritone
voice and a vocabulary that was always
It. The Spieler carried more education
than any man on the pay-roll and it was
said that he was the only man in the outfit
that could read the Latin names on the
animal cages. It was generally supposed
that he was one of the better days’ boys,
but he never told the story of his past life
to any of the gang.</p>

<p>It had started to rain just after the
afternoon performance, and as it was the
night to strike and haul, the six squatters
on the ring bank were silent and sore.
The Spieler came in from the menagerie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and joined the layout. He never sat
down, so he stood for a while in front of
the others. No one spoke and he let a
little conversation hit the air.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you fellows?
Sore ’cause it is raining! Don’t see why,
you all are under cover. I’ve got to stand
out there in front of the tent and talk for
dimes.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Boss Canvasman, “and
I’ve got this tent to roll up an’ load.</p>

<p>“Well be happy, be happy,” said the
Spieler. Then after a pause. “Say, you
fellows can help me out a little. The Boss
gives me a talk last night, and says while
the spiel for the little show is all right and
good he wants a new one for the big
stands we strikes next week. I’ve been
digging up the old talk I used to tear off
on the Midway at the Chicago Show and
I’ve about studied her out, if youse don’t
care I’ll just unroll here an’ see if its the
proper josh.”</p>

<p>There was no objection, so the Spieler
mounts one of the red painted stools, the
object holders stand on for the little lady
to jump the banners. Then he serves his
spiel:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now good people if you will
kindly give me your attention for a few
moments I will explain to you the great
congress of freaks, oddities of mother nature
and strange and curious collection of
wonders shown in the tent. Remember
you have plenty of time, the Big Show
does not commence for fully harf an hour.
Surely you will not leave the lot until you
have seen all&mdash;all good people&mdash;all provided
for you in this monster entertainment,
this caravan of canvas covered
world sought wonders. Come a little
closer. Please. Thank you. First, let me
call your attention to a remarkable group
of reindeer. We have not one&mdash;three&mdash;five&mdash;or
six of these specimens of the
animal kingdom, but a whole herd
of them&mdash;a herd of them&mdash;a herd
of reindeer from the land of the
midnight sun, where there is but one
night, one day&mdash;reindeers, my friends,
from the icy mountains of far away Norway
the greatest group ever exhibited in
any colossal enterprise that has ever been
organized by mortal man.</p>

<p>“Next you will find the ostrich farm.
This strange bird that furnishes plumage
for me ladies’ bonnet, and that comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
from the sunny sands of Africa. And remember
the cool of the evening is the best
time to see the ostriches, for it is then you
may notice their marked pe-cu-li-ar-i-ties.
Listen, good people, reindeer and ostriches&mdash;reindeer
from the frozen north&mdash;ostriches
from torrid Africa&mdash;specimens
from each zone, the most astounding
representation of nature’s wonderland
ever shown. Reindeer and ostriches&mdash;as
the poet says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“From Greenland’s icy mountains</div>
<div class="verse">From Afric’s coral strand</div>
<div class="verse">Where them crystal waters</div>
<div class="verse">Run down the heathen land.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“And all for a dime, ten cents, will you
hesitate? but wait, good people, that is
not all. The wonder of wonders is yet
to come&mdash;Bobo&mdash;he eats ’em alive, he
eats ’em alive. You must see Bobo. This
strange and curious specimen of humanity
who exists upon poisonous reptiles,
captured in the jungles of the Tasmanian
blue gum tree and brought to civilized
America, he still lives on snakes&mdash;Bobo,
the snake eater&mdash;Bobo, he eats ’em alive,
he eats ’em alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“One moment, good people, one moment&mdash;this
is not all. Listen&mdash;Wild Rose&mdash;the
half girl and half dog. This remarkable
freak of nature that has puzzled the
scientists of two continents. Queen
Mary, the largest fat woman ever shown
under canvas or in hall of curios, the
marvelous Samson, the giant of today,
who bears upon his breast great rocks to
be broken with a sledge, and last but not
least&mdash;Professor Corello and his troupe
of performing roaches, the only attempt
ever made to develop the hitherto unknown
powers of these insects. The
greatest, most interesting and educating
avalanche of remarkable freaks and
strange and curious people ever shown.
And all for a dime, two nickels, good
people&mdash;a dime, but a dime. The performance
is about to begin&mdash;one dime&mdash;the
sight of an invested fortune, the
greatest stroke of genius of the modern
showman&mdash;yours for a dime.”</p>

<p>The Spieler took a long breath and
then looked at his audience.</p>

<p>“How’s that,” he asked, “how’s that
for a furnace talk?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Cap,” said the Concert
Manager; “it’ll bring ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say,” said the Boss Canvasman, “how
do you keep that voice of yours shoutin’
all the time?”</p>

<p>“Boozin’, boozin’ up,” said the Spieler,
“boozin’ up.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_BAND_MASTERS_SOLO">THE BAND MASTER’S SOLO</h2>

<p>The leader of the Big Show’s band
wasn’t much on technique, but if
there were any notes coming to an
E-flat cornet that he had overlooked
something was wrong with the whole
theory of music.</p>

<p>The way he could blow melody out of
that piece of polished brass was something
that the rest of the outfit never understood.
He was a little fellow with a
very small moustache that ran largely to
waxed ends. He always wore a blue uniform
and a cap, and he looked like a messenger
boy. The twenty-eight “star soloists”
that he directed possessed more
wind than a Western cyclone and an Eastern
typhoon blown into one, for twice a
day they played from one-thirty until the
last race in the hippodrome was off, and
this was no five finger exercise.</p>

<p>The gang was rather talkative when
the leader came across from the band
stand, so he sat down on the corner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
elevated stage and hummed to himself.
Presently the chorus cut out and he soloed
thusly:</p>

<p>“I ain’t no Sousa, boys, an’ there ain’t
no brass hangin’ to my pea jacket, but
say, if there’s any leader that can get
more noise out of them 28 than I can, I’ll
eat every bit of sawdust under the tent an’
say thankee when I’m done.”</p>

<p>Nobody disputed this distinction and
the leader continued to cadenza:</p>

<p>“It ain’t no snap tossin’ off melody for
a show like this. When I’m out with the
minstrels in the winter the game’s easy,
but the snap is nothin’ but blow, an’
you’ve got a lot of crazy ones in the ring
here to take cues from. An’ talkin’ about
them 28 of mine, there ain’t no show band
in the country that can beat ’em
switchin’.”</p>

<p>“Say, you know the night we opened in
the Garden? Well, we was playin’ ‘The
Holy City’ for the guy in spangles what
rolls hissef up the spiral. The music plot
was ‘Holy City’ to the top, a little of the
shiver while he was makin’ the last turn,
an’ then a lot of brass an’ bing-bing when
he makes the rush to the ring. Well, the
boys were playin’ the ‘Holy City’ fine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
daisy when the equestrian director comes
across the track an’ whispers:</p>

<p>“‘Here’s Dewey comin’ up by the reserved
section.’</p>

<p>“So I knows he wants somethin’ appropriate,
an’ I gives the signal for ‘Here
Comes a Sailor.’ Well, them twenty-eight
switches like a limited on a clear
track an’ the crowd on the boards goes
wild. But the guy in the tin ball, he’s
been kneelin’ it up to ‘The Holy City,’ an’
when the music changes to swift he can’t
work his knees fas’ enough an’ he lets
go an’ nearly breaks his back. He calls
me a Dutch somethin’, I didn’t jes’ catch,
an’ it costs him 25 fine off the pay sheet.</p>

<p>“An’ speakin’ about noise, fifteen year
ago I leaves home, where I was workin’
in a harness factory and leadin’ the Silver
Cornet Band in the evenin’, an’ goes
on the road with a medicine show. We
has one of them long-haired boys doin’
the fake dentist an’ pullin’ teeth without
pain while his wife does the female doctor
an’ sells pills. We six brass has to
play when Doc an’ his wife is workin’, an’
in the mornin’ go back of the stage an’
roll pills an’ put ’em in fancy boxes what
Doc sells with the packages of Australian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gold pens, the little joker transparent
cards an’ the South American Cyroola
Corn Cure what he gives away to each
an’ every purchaser of Dr. Sorino’s Death
Delayin’ Pellets.</p>

<p>“Well, the game was to git some coon
in the crowd to come up on the stage an’
have his tooth pulled for nothin’ an’ without
pain. Doc gets the moke in the chair
an’ makes his spiel ’bout the great pain
killer he has an’ says it won’t hurt the
boy on the velvet. The band was all
brass except Cooney Watson, who was
playin’ a kettle drum an’ workin’ the bass
and cymbals with a pedal. While Doc
was gittin’ the forceps on the tooth we
played soft an’ quiet like an’ as soon as
he gives the jerk we lets loose with a
march an’ you can’t hear nigger man
holler to save your life. It was great, an’
it worked the countries all the times.
Cooney would make you think there was
a thunder storm comin’ up the way he
beat them drums.</p>

<p>“But poor Cooney. Doc picks up six
Indians to make the show stronger an’ introduce
his famous Indian bitters. The
red boys had a new moon an’ asks Cooney
to loan ’em the drum to do the Tom Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Cooney says no an’ the Big Chief gets
good an’ sore, but says nothin’. The next
day we has a parade an’ we brass is on
top of a wagon with Doc’s ads, painted on
the side. The Indians is ridin’ along behind
us. Well, say, we had hardly hit
the main street when the Indian what was
sore on the drummer throws his lariat
and lassos poor Cooney off the wagon,
drums an’ all, into the middle of a bunch
of cows what was gettin’ weighed. He
was pretty bad, so we shipped him home.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t Cooney beatin’ the drum
with us, is it?” asks the Boss Canvasman
as he tied a long running knot in the guy
rope to the net under the swings for the
brother act.</p>

<p>“No indeed,” says the Leader, “Cooney
never joins out again. The las’ I seen of
him he was workin’ at his trade out in
Indianny&mdash;he was paintin’ the roof of the
courthouse when we had the parade.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_CANDY_BUTCHER">THE CANDY BUTCHER
TALKS ABOUT A LOVE AFFAIR AND
HIS ENCOUNTER WITH THE
BUCKWHEAT MAN.</h2>

<p>The Candy Butcher of the
Big Show looked like a cut-out in
a Sunday supplement. He was
the best dressed man in the outfit, and no
matter what he was doing and where he
was doing it he always looked fixed up,
and he felt it.</p>

<p>His pants were always creased whether
the show was doing a run in the large
city or playing the one-nighters on a single-track
jerk-water beyond the Wabash.
He never wore his coat when working,
and his loud linen would have stopped a
limited with one flash from the tower.
He was there with the pink underwear,
and his stockings had more kinds of color
in them than the side of the band wagon
when the season was new. The Candy
Butcher was always dressed, and when he
got behind the counter to pull off the
“Five tonight, good people!” gag he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
would have made the window of an East
Side gents’ furnishing store drop the curtain.
The Candy Butcher didn’t mix in
much with the men in the outfit. He had a
chemical moustache that he zephyred
with a velvet voice, and he was always
aces with the ladies. When Section One
was pulling out for a long Sunday jump,
be sure of Him for the day coach with
the girls. He was good at that, and,
while he didn’t always make a landing,
he managed generally to get his bowline
fast to the pier before the current caught
him.</p>

<p>He always wore his coat in the meal
tent, but he took it off right after supper
and carried it on his arm. The make-up
didn’t miss the ulster much, for he had on
a vest that was three strikes and out for
rainbow colors&mdash;one of those rum
omelette tinted things that a Philadelphia
button buyer puts on for Saturday night
when he’s waiting at the stage door for
some spotlight Sadie. He was there with
the cheap tailors, all right.</p>

<p>The squatters on the ring bank were
just settling for the afternoon gab while
the equestrian director, sore because he
couldn’t get away to keep a date, was rearranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the horse acts with a piece of a
pencil on the back of the night’s card.
The Candy Butcher came through a
crevice in the tent and stopped to talk to
the Saw Dust Spreader, who was standing
behind the wardrobe basket pulling
on his plush pants.</p>

<p>“What you dressin’ for?” said the
Candy Butcher.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re gettin’ cheap,” said the
Saw Dust Spreader. “I’ve got to double
for an object holder, an’ I’m up for the
leaps right after the entree.”</p>

<p>“What do you care,” said the Candy
Butcher, “long as peppermint is striped?”</p>

<p>Then he laughed at his own little trade
journal joke. He was full of those. He
was always reading song books and joke
budgets when waiting to get up on the
blue boards to sell tickets for the concert
after the show. He came across the track
and joined the gang.</p>

<p>“Gee!” said the Side Show Spieler,
who was always good on the opening line,
“youse dressed up for fair tonight! Looks
like youse goin’ to a birthday party.”</p>

<p>“Not for me,” replied the Candy
Butcher, as he put another piece of gum
under the mustache. “Cut out the parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
for Willie in the Summer an’ after this
in the winter no more front parlor talks
for me after ma is in bed an’ the old man
is out in the cold switchin’ down in the
railroad yard.”</p>

<p>“Sore again,” said the Concert Manager;
“you’ve always got your kick comin’
on sumthin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t,” said the Candy
Butcher, “but you fellows is allus runnin’
me in when it comes to any girl talk. Say,
I ain’t the masher of this outfit, take it
from me. If I could do the look killin’
an’ have ’em runnin’ me like the boy what
does the principal bareback&mdash;the popcorn
and the soft drinks&mdash;well, no more for
Jamesie.”</p>

<p>The gang sort of warmed up to this
talk, so he let her out another notch and
began.</p>

<p>“Say,” he continued, “youse fellows is
allus lookin’ for sumthin’ soft. Well,
say, I’ve got a game for this season that
will kill ’em. No more kicks over the
lemonade tub for me. I’ve got ’em all
skinned on the sour juice game. Say, you
may not know it, but it’s a losin’ game
when you’r runnin’ to one-nighters and
sellin’ lemon juice. It looks good to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
me hollerin’ over the chunk of ice an’
takin’ in the half dimes while I’m passin’
out the cold drink an’ the peanuts; but,
say, you never thought how many of
them nicks it takes to buy a box of lemons.
All right, all right in the city, bo’,
for the yellow boys, but when you are run
out in the meadows it’s diff’rent, diff’rent.</p>

<p>“So, says I, during the winter when
I’m managin’ me penny arcade wid the
talkin’ machines, says, ’ll get up a scheme
that will make the lemons back to the
shady groves for you, no more fore me.
An’, say, I gits me think tank on it and I
invents sumthin’. Say, you’ll laugh, but
I pulled it off this afternoon, an’, say,
they all fell for once.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Bill?” asked the Old
Grafter, always ready for a new shot at
the purse.</p>

<p>“‘What is it?’ Well, say! You know
how them guys is stringin’ you about fake
lemonade, ’cause you ain’t got no yellow
slices floatin’ on the top of the tub. Well,
what is you goin’ to do when lemons is
45 per, an’ even the barkeeps is usin’ the
acid for the sour. Well, me, I just has
a dozen lemon slices made out of celluloid,
an’, say, Bill, you can’t tell ’em from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
real, ’pon my word, boy, when they is
floatin’ aroun’ in the tub after I has
poured in me water, me citric acid and
me sugar. Why, say, it looks like one of
them things at a Fresh Air give-out,
where everything is dun on the level,
’cause the reporters is watchin’. I jes’
works me celluloid slices on the stan’, an’
when biz is dun wipes ’em off, puts ’em
in the box, an’ theyse jes’ as good as new,
an’ there’s more comin’ to the Dime Savin’
for Will, an’ that’s no song book wit.”</p>

<p>The crowd eyed him in silence with
that awe that meets a pack of undergraduates
when they first gaze upon the
man who discovered some new chemical
analysis they never expect to understand.</p>

<p>The Saw Dust Spreader joined the
crowd just then looking like a cheap leading
man in a ten and twenty “Carmen,”
with the red pants and the little coat. It
was he for gossip, so he broke in.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re pretty good,” he said to
the Candy Butcher, remembering the
laugh he got when he came across the tan
bark. “But, say, where was you all last
week? No lyin’ now, Willie, ’cause I’m
on, dead on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I dunno that it’s any secret,”
said the Candy Butcher. “I dun me duty
an’ I suffered for it.”</p>

<p>The gang looked like a listening party,
so he began to reel:</p>

<p>“Say, it’s pretty tough when a fellow
starts out to do the right thing by a little
lady and gets the flag. It jes’ shows that
whenever you gits to dreamin’ good
somebody is goin’ to give you an alarm
clock finish an’ let you wake up with a
shriek. Remember two seasons ago, when
we was workin’ the Congress of Nations
gag in the manager’s tent? Well,
me it is who meets a little lady who is doin’
the bead stitchin’ in the gypsy village.
She’s a pretty little thing an’ quietlike.
Well, she seems lonesome like an’ one
wet night I carries her across the lot when
the mud is up to your knees. She seems
to like it an’ we has a long talk in the car.</p>

<p>“It seems that she used to work in a
bean place where she is called Number
8. I thinks that is funny, so I allus calls
her Number 8.</p>

<p>“Seems like her folks was sore on her
for troopin’, an’ she comes to me for sympathy.
Well, she had me stoppin’ the
booze before we was two weeks out, an’ I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
was gettin’ quiet in me gab and cuttin’
down on the swear talk. She tells me the
way she gets into the circus is that a big
guy what was engagin’ people for the
Congress used to eat his butter cakes at
her table, an’ he keeps on tellin’ her what
a fine life it is to be an actress, an’, as he
has been readin’ about it in books, she
throws up the waitin’ job and joins out.
The big guy gets half of her first week for
the gettin’ her the job.</p>

<p>“But it seems that when Number 8
pulls out of the bean place that she breaks
the heart of the guy with the white cap
that cooks the buckwheats in the window.
He’s been sweet on her from the first day
she hollered the hot cakes an’ he pulls ’em
off the griddle an’ looks into her eyes.
Well, this guy takes a solemn oath that
he’ll kill the bloke that makes his Mamie
give up waitin’ an’ go troopin’. He never
gets next to the big jay what gave her the
job, but when he was doin’ the big city
he sees me chasin’ her home every night.
He gives me a look I don’t like, an’ I asks
Number 8 what it means.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, don’t mind him’ she says, ‘he
used to belong to my euchre.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, if I’d been wise I’d a-known
Number 8 was connin’, for what did that
little fairy know about euchre parties? I
knows now that she was pullin’ off some
speech she heard in the theatre where the
lady shoots the dook across the card table
because he brings the coachman into the
parlor to get a drink while the other dook
is sayin’ his good-by speech. I is too
sweet on the fairy then to know that she’s
connin’ me.</p>

<p>“Well, jes’ the last week we was playin’
New York, who does I meet in the park
lookin’ at the fish but Number 8. She
looks so sweet an’ nice that it all comes
back, an’ me up an’ speaks. She says
sorter haughty:</p>

<p>“‘Who are you, sir? Whom are you
addressin’?</p>

<p>“Say, that hit me like a blast, when all
of a sudden I get a welt across the head
wid sumthin’ that is iron. Say, I falls,
but is up, and though the knock has given
me the blood, I see that it’s the guy what
cooks the buckwheats in the window who
was tryin’ to do the killin’. An’ say, he
has run out of his bean place an’ hit me
wid the cake turner. I grasps him, an’ it’s
catch-as-catch-can, an’ Number 8 screamin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
on the bench. I gives him a couple of
good ones when in a jiffy it’s rainin’
plates an’ coffee cups, an’ I’m gettin, ’em
on the face. Say, his whole gang from
the bean shop was out in their white coats,
throwin’ the crockery an’ me gettin’ it.</p>

<p>“I knows the show is shut up an’ help
is a long way off. Somebody yells, ‘Lick
the brute,’ an’ I gets another pie plate in
the eye.</p>

<p>“‘What’s he done?’ says a cab driver.</p>

<p>“‘He insulted me wife,’ said the buckwheat
cake man.</p>

<p>“I tried to explain, but he gives me another
one with the cake-turner an’ I’m on
the asphalt.</p>

<p>“I’se gettin’ it good, an’ I sees I must
get help or cut the season for the city
ward. So I yells ‘Hey, Rube!’</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think? There was
a couple of old tramps a-sleepin’ on a
bench, an’ when they hears me scream,
me on me back wid the buckwheat man
sittin’ on me, I sees ’em move, I yells it
again, an’ one of them wearies says:</p>

<p>“‘That sounds familiar-like to me.’</p>

<p>“‘Hey, Rube!’ I gives it again, an’,
say, they gets in, an’ they put that waiter
gang into a pile that looks like a hash
brown in a spill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what happened to you?” said
the Canvasman, who was always there for
the battle tales.</p>

<p>“Me, say, I gets it all. A couple of dinnys
pulls me to a box, an’ in the cell all
night for me. An’, say, if it hadn’t been
for James A., Lord bless his soul, me to
the island for winter quarters an’ in
stripes.”</p>

<p>“But what becomes of the fairy?” says
the Saw Dust Spreader, who always likes
to know the finish.</p>

<p>“What becomes of her?” says the
Candy Butcher, feeling a couple of scars.
“I hears it all later. She had married the
guy an’ moves over to Jersey. He’s
keepin’ a saloon, an’ she’s cookin’ the
oysters. He gives one with every drink.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_CONCERT_MANAGER_GETS">THE CONCERT MANAGER GETS REMINISCENT.</h2>

<p>The manager of the concert
company looked like a Methodist
minister going to see the bishop.
He wore a high silk hat and a last-winter’s
double-breasted coat. Whenever he
talked he held the hat in one hand and
rubbed it with the other so that it looked
like a clipped yearling at a country run
off. His voice was a deep bass, and when
he did the “remember good people the
Big Show is not yet ’arf over” from the
elevated stage you could gamble on the
words hitting every ear.</p>

<p>He was sitting on the ring bank looking
over his touch list when the conversation
grew wavy and then dropped to a
hush.</p>

<p>“This here tent business is pullin’ down
to a theatrical man,” he said as he lighted
a choked stogie. “Give me the hall show
every time for the cush and comfort an’
I’ll be easy an’ shippin’ in money to the
backer if the bookin’s is good. The rep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
shows is the thing me boys if you can deliver,
an’ you can strike territory that ain’t
been ploughed to death by a lot of
yellows.</p>

<p>“Had out a rep company that was a
winner. We was playin’ ‘East Lynne’ and
doin’ it good with six people and a band
on the balcony at 7 to 8. The way we
threw them dramatic chunks into the ten,
twenty and thirts was sumthin’ remark’ble.
We wasn’t connin’ neither, but givin’
’em a show that had ’em weepin’ from
ring up to las’ curt’n. Say, I had a leadin’
lady that was the genuine. She had been
up three times before the school commissioners
for declaimin’ an’ her old man
thought she was a Mary Anderson. We
joshed him along on the Mary Anderson
gag an’ the old guy checked in with a five
hundred for a starter to get the fit up and
the gal’s costumes. Say, she was a blonde
with a figure that set the town hall tonight
people on the road to ruin with all
brakes off. The leadin’ man was a cuff
juggler and he wouldn’t settle down, but
he doubled in props an’ was all right. The
heavy was one of those chesty boys who
was alles givin’ me the jab ‘when I was
with Booth.’ He started out all right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
all right in the first act, but he died out
before the curt’n got down; the old man
was pretty rotten, thank you, but the way
he could play an E flat cornet on the balcony
was sumthin’ strictly proper. I’m
jes’ tellin’ youse what you can do with a
lot of bum players, if you’ve got the
goods, an’ youse gets the bookin’s. I was
workin’ the crowd on a $300 salary an’
playin’ up into the gross on $750 a week
an’ livin’ like the man what owns his lay
out. But I let go.</p>

<p>“You see some of the managers down
on the coal oil circuit in Central Pennsylvania
got the vaudeville bug and was yellin’
for specialties. So I gets the soubrette
to do a rag time stunt between the second
an’ third, an’ the first night the gal’ry
window jumps nine and a half to the
good. I says that’s what they wants an’
I keeps the specialty in for good. But the
Lady Isabel of the push was getting artistic
an’ she says no to the specialty. I says
yes, an’ her old man comes on an’ says
Mary Anderson didn’t have no gal singin’
and showin’ her legs in her show, so
me an’ the old guy plays quits. Well, it
was gettin’ warm, so I picks up me little
soubrette, gets a privilege at a fair an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
starts in to do the black tent. We had a
little round top, blacker on the inside
than a Bow’ry alley. The game was to
get the yaps inside, all lights out, flash the
calcium, an’ then do the floatin’ illusion.
The little gal would float roun’ the tent
an’ hand me out roses, and the gang
would go daffy. You see she was rigged
up in one of these white gowns an’ was
chasin’ round in a back flap stickin’ her
head and body through wherever I had a
slit. But I has a good lime light man an’
the payin’s never coupled to the con.</p>

<p>“It was good for thirty a day and the
privilege was cheap, but say, the finish
was tragic. You see the gal had run off
from home, where she was makin’ three
dollars spinnin’ yarn in a mill an’ payin’
her people two fifty board. She gets
stuck on the show business an’ goes out
with a rep, where I picks her up. Well,
it seems that her old man gets sort o’
dippy ’cause he didn’ do the right thing
by the little one an’ started out to fin’ her.
Somebody tells the old boy she is dead an’
he falls down for a while. But he gets
up and goes wanderin’ ’bout to all the
shows lookin’ for the gal. Well, he gets
into my show one day an’ when we flashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the illusion there’s a yell an’ the old one
says, ‘me daughter, me daughter,’ and
the gal flops an’ breaks up the show. She
gets sorry an’ goes home with the gray
hair an’ I loses the graft and strikes this.”</p>

<p>The Boss Canvasman started in to do
a little cussin’ because the round top over
the stage was sagging and he broke up
the talk.</p>

<p>But the Press Agent wants the finish of
the yarn, and he speaks up:</p>

<p>“Well, Pop, what became of the gal?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says Pop, “the old man goes under
the ground an’ the jig stepper goes
back to the business. Last season she
was doublin’ with the iron chested man
doin’ a singin’ specialty in the side show.
But they’s both out now. The iron
chested man is yellin’ the stations on the
Ninth Avenue L, and the Mamie girl is
makin’ ten a week posin’ for chromos that
you wouldn’t hang over the thermometer,
s’ help me.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_HANDS_AT_THE">THE HANDS AT THE WINDOW.</h2>

<p>The man who sold the red paste-boards
at the ticket wagon always
dressed better than the man who owned
the circus. He ran largely to striped
vests and wore shirts that were of the sassiest
shade of pink. Like the Candy
Butcher, he never wore his coat when he
was working, but the vest and the trousers
made him a swell enough picture.
The rest of the outfit regarded him with
the same awe that fills the spirit of a man
earning twelve dollars a week who accidentally
runs into J. Pierpont Morgan.
To be sure, the Ticket Seller never had
as much cash as the Wall Street man, but
he made a bigger flash. He always carried
a roll, and as his accounts never
failed to balance and he stood good with
the Boss, it was generally presumed that
the gold boys he carried in his upper vest
pocket were his own.</p>

<p>The gang that talked on the ring bank
between the afternoon and the night show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
had great respect for this member of the
outfit. He had a line of talk that sounded
big, and that was always inspiring to the
crowd. He knew just what the Big
Show was taking in, and he liked to talk
about it. He talked figures, and the ring
bank crowd only knew it by the thousands
of people that roosted on the blue boards
when the bill was being run off under the
main top. In the winter months, when
the Big Show had gone to quarters, the
Ticket Man managed a burlesque house
in Chicago, and it was said that he wore
so many diamonds on the pink bosom that
it wasn’t necessary to turn on the lobby
lights when the night audience was coming
in. He was a loud boy, all right, but
he backed the noise with coin. When the
Ticket Man wasn’t talking about money,
he let loose a bunch of racing talk that
would have feazed the principal writer on
a daily turf sheet. He used words that
seldom got farther than the paddock, and
he picked winners like a diamond expert
getting out the real shines from a pile of
glass.</p>

<p>And with both lines of talk he had ’em
all faded when it came to the con. He
had a line of explanations that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
make any man think he threw down a
two-spot when he knew that he walked
up to the window with a double X.</p>

<p>“Lemme tell you fellows sumthin’” he
said, as he came in after supper in the
meal tent and sat down for a smoke.
“You’se can always hear a lot of knockin’
for the boys what sells in the wagon.
Now take it from me, don’t youse believe
a word of it till youse gets the other side.
You hear a lot of hollerin’ that ev’rybody
is gettin’ done, and that the boys in
the wagon is buyin’ gov’ment bonds and
furnishing flats on the short change
graft. But it ain’t so&mdash;not altogether. It
was in the old days, when I started in the
business, but it ain’t now. Graftin’ is
dead, take it from me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Old Grafter, with a
deep sigh, “you’re right, Bill, graftin’ is
dead, an’ it was a sorry day for me when
it died.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Jim; half way right,
but it won’t go these days. But what I’m
tellin’ you is right; when you is sellin’
hard tickets to a long line that is rushin’
to get to the tent, youse can’t go out and
have a personal interview with every man
that runs away an’ leaves his change on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the window. An’ say, whose goin’ to take
chances givin’ it up when he does come
back? Not me, not me; I see me little
bank-roll in the Dime Savin’s lookin’ like
a busted baloon on the end of the season.
Say, don’t make no mistake, ev’ry hand
at the window is a hand ag’in’ you. I
know what I’m talkin’ about. There ain’t
a man in the country who don’t think he’s
doin’ a smart trick when he beats a circus
man out of money. They’ll all do you
when they can. Mark my word. I’ve
been passing out hard tickets with this
outfit for nine years an’ long before that
with a fly-by-night, an’ I knows the game&mdash;ev’ry
hand that comes up to that window
will do you if it can. I’ve had too
many Reubs hand me a two-dollar bill an’
say it was a tenner.”</p>

<p>“What do you do then?” asked the
Concert Manager.</p>

<p>“Do?” said the Ticket Man. “Do?
Why, I’d just look Reuben in the eye an’
say Brush on, haysy, you ain’t got a ten;
wait till you sell your wheat an’ come back
an’ then I’ll gamble with you.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right now, dead square an’ on
the level, but youse know what it was in
the graftin’ days,” he continued, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wiped the dust off his patent leathers with
a horse plume. “We turned the season
them days with a bunch of money that
was all our own, and nobody kickin’. I
was out with a little graftin’ show that
had more gamblin’ on one lot than a
county fair, an’, say, I wasn’t takin’ no
chances with them grafters an’ tinhorns!
I knowed the countries would buy their
tickets before they went at the games, an’
say, I wasn’t overlookin’ my bit.</p>

<p>“Me an’ the fixer stood pat. He travelled
three days ahead, an’ had it all
squared with the Mayor of the burg and
the police so the games could go on an’
no kick. Well, he would get hold of a
smart lookin’ constable, take him aroun’
back of the courthouse and give him a
talk. The constable likes it bein’ taken
into the confidence of a showman, an’ lets
ev’rybody see it, ’cause he’s proud.</p>

<p>“Well, the fixer sez, ‘You’re a smart
lookin’ young man; you do me a turn
when the show comes, an’ if the Boss likes
you, he may take you along for Chief
Detective!’</p>

<p>“Say, that hits the Reub so hard, that
Chief Detective talk, and for three days
he’s seein’ visions of hisself flashin’ his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
tin all along the line. Well, he reports to
me, and I gives him instructions and a
ten-dollar bill, with promise of a five after
the show if he does his work. I posts
him in front of the window, and has him
fixed to butt in when there’s any kick, an’
say, ‘No arguments; keep movin’, gentlemen!’</p>

<p>“An’ he does it good, and I throws the
short change, an’ with the band a goin’
in the tent and the crowd crazy to get at
the games, I picks out a little bag of coin
before the tinhorns lands on the roll. An’
me helper, who was a bit of a mechanic,
he takes the sill of the window in the
wagon and tilts it with the slant to the inside.
A guy comes along and throws up
a dollar bill, and says give me one. With
one hand I throw down the ticket, an’
with the other throw up two quarters, or
a quarter two tens and a five. They hit
the glass, an’ say, with that slant some of
it was sure to come back, an’ Mr. Man
is in too big a hurry for the Big Show to
notice, an’ the constable, who’s to get the
five, keeps ’em movin’. At night the constable
says he wants to have a private conversation
an’ takes me off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Look a here,’ sez he, ‘that agent
ahead of the circus sez if I could do the
work I might be made chief detective.’</p>

<p>“Not a word, keep quiet, says I.
You’ll spoil it.</p>

<p>“The constable don’t just get next, but
it soun’s good. ‘See that man over there?’
sez I. Constable looks aroun’ an’ sees
the big boy that allus stood by the gate
an’ who wasn’t no more of an officer than
me.</p>

<p>“Well, sez I, that man has been
watchin’ you. He’s Mr. Pinkerton himself,
and as soon as he makes out his
official report to Superintendent Byrnes
you gets the job. He thanks me an’ I
give him the fivespot. He goes home an’
tells ev’rybody for the names I spring
was so good he didn’t see through the
con. But, of course, I’ve got to give the
fixer a bit. An’ say, that’s the trouble
with graftin’. You’ve got to fix too many
people to keep from gettin’ a holler. But
none of it now. I stick to what I says,
that ev’ry hand that comes up to the window
is a hand ag’in’ you, and will do you
if it can. You’re goin’ to get short
change, all right, but don’t do no old-fashioned
graftin’. I tell you there’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
only one way to get it honest, an’ if the
band is playin’ while you’re sellin’, it will
keep your line movin’ at the window, an’
it’s a poor evenin’ you can’t pick up fifteen
at least that was left and nobody
hurt. Of course, I calls them back&mdash;but
I never could holler loud.”</p>

<p>The Ticket Man took out a solid gold
watch, with a stop movement, and his
initials in diamonds on the back.</p>

<p>“Well, guess I better get at it,” and
he left and went to the ticket wagon,
where on the inside he sat on a little stool
with the tickets in one hand and the
change on the other side.</p>

<p>Then the hands began to come up and
he was at work again.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CONCERT_MANAGER_TELLS">THE CONCERT MANAGER TELLS THE BOYS AN ELEPHANT YARN.</h2>

<p>The concert manager
looked like a corn doctor who had
dressed up to go to the City
Hall for his license. He always wore
a long black coat, and when a healthy
ray of sunshine hit it square in the
back it threw off a glare like a locomotive
reflector. He had a smooth face,
wore his hair long, and it was his proudest
boast that once down in Texarkana
he had been asked if he was William Jennings
Bryan. As the question was put
by a swarthy Democrat who wanted to
buy “sumthin’,” he said he was, and they
both liquored up the rest of the afternoon,
and no discoveries.</p>

<p>The Concert Manager had sifted the
English language down to about nine five-syllable
words, and the rest of his talk
was only ordinary. His voice was his
big hit. He could stand on the elevated
stage between Ring One and Ring Two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and no matter what was going on hit
every ear drum with his gag about “directly
after the performance,” “you need
not leave your seats,” and that “the gentlemanly
ushers would soon pass along
selling tickets.” His voice got him all of
the announcing, and he had a shape that
always cast him for some big guy with
fake whiskers when they were doing anything
spectacular for the entree.</p>

<p>He loved to address the multitude. Let
the gang sit down on the ring bank for a
chat before the night show, and it was he
to cut in with a talk&mdash;something he knew
all about and which had the rest of the
boys winging before he hit the end of the
first chapter. He had more different
kinds of talk than any man in the outfit,
and he always yearned to be handing it
out. In the winter he ran a hall show
with a company that would take a fall out
of anything from “Hamlet” to a melodrama
with three big effects and a wholesale
killing in each act. The gang was
telling hard luck stories when he came
across the track, and he was ready with
one at the first cue.</p>

<p>“‘Say, boys,’ he said with one of those
back platform gestures, ‘I’ll tell you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
star hard luck story&mdash;say, the best, and
no appeal. Me, a long time ago playing
the little towns in Ohio with a merry-go-round.
Think of it, yes, but don’t laugh,
for it was a good game in them days and
I was turnin’ coin. We put up on a lot
for four days for a county fair, an’ business
is so good that I stops sleepin’ back
of the tent an’ goes to the inn. Well, say,
the barkeeper of that tavern was a pass
fiend for fair, an’ he keeps strikin’ me for
free rides on the wooden horses. I laughs
him off, but he keeps at it. So one day
I gets mad an’ throws him hard. He
looks at me over the black bottle an’ sez:
‘Say, you give a free ride ev’ry time they
gets the brass ring, don’t ye?’</p>

<p>“I says ‘yes,’ an’ he shuts up like a law
abider, an’ that ends it. But what do you
suppose that glass rubber does? Say, he
comes out to the lot with his gang, an’
while he wasn’t lookin’ he pours a hole
bottle of gildin’ fluid into the ring slide,
an’ say, everybody on the lot was gettin’
gold rings an’ ridin’ free all night. It
hit me so hard I had to fold up and to the
wagons an’ do the sneak without settlin’
me last payment on the privilege to the
fair folks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>This seemed to please the ring bank
crowd and the Concert Manager was full
of loose gab. Finally the talk drifted to
animals, and then to elephants, and up
speaks the Concert Manager.</p>

<p>“I never comes through the animal
tent and sees the elephant herd,” he says,
“but it has me rememberin’ sumthin’ that
happens when I’m with the John Robinson
show doin’ the talkin’ from the ring
an’ makin’ me extra with a couple of blackface
turns, a singin’ act an’ a knockabout
after the Big Show.</p>

<p>“Say, for real heart them elephants has
got all humanity beat to a standstill.
Seems to me that the worst weakness that
is in the breast of man is the feelin’ that
pulls him away from another man when
they ought to be stickin’ together. Say,
it ain’t many a man that remembers a
good turn, and kind acts is forgotten as
quick as money that’s owin’. But them
big boys with the trunks, say, they ain’t
forgettin’ nothin’. Youse can do a good
turn for a man an’ he’ll throw you the
next day, but the elephant ain’t forgettin’
the one what has done him sumthin’ good,
be he man or beast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, in them days we was carryin’
six big fellows, an’ part of my game was
to let their backs out to the storekeepers
for banners. I’d lay it out with some
drygoods dealer that was enterprisin’
enough to do some real sensational advertisin’.
Then we’d have the banners
painted, swing ’em over the backs, an’
Mr. Mann has a good showin’ when we
makes the parade down the street. I was
payin’ the trainer a little extry to see that
the banners got on, and, say, that boy for
liquor was the original reservoir. It
seems that the money I’m givin’ him
allus buys a drink. He keeps it up right
along an’ gits many a warnin’. There
wasn’t a guy with the outfit that could
handle the beasts like he could, an’ the
Boss was allus afeerd sumthin’ would
happen.</p>

<p>“And it did by and by. The trainer
don’t pay attention to the warnin’, and
one matinee he queers the act. He gets
his elephants all mixed up in his ring, an’
there comes near bein’ a breakaway but
for a lot of spearin’. The Boss sees it all,
an’ he gets the trainer out without any
talk. The boys gets the elephants back to
their stable, but ev’ry one is looking for
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, say, the Big Show is started an’
about halfway through when the Boss
Canvasman is ready to strike the animal
tent an’ make for the cars. The horses is
put to the dens, an’ they is all soon on the
road, with the walkin’ stock followin’.
Then the boys gets to the elephants an’
tries to start ’em, but not a one will move.
They gives them the spear, but not a
move. They gets to hollerin’ an’ more
spearin’, but they might as well tried to
move mountains. The Boss come in, an’
he tries it, but no go. They moves a lot
of hay down the lot, thinkin’ it will make
’em look for another feedin’, but no go.
Then one of the trainers what had been
helpin’ the head trainer stan’s out an’
calls ’em by name. They flaps their big
ears, but not a move. It’s time for the
section to be pullin’ out, an’ we all hands
is up against it.</p>

<p>“Well, I sez to myself, here’s your
chance to be smart an’ redeem it all for
Jed,&mdash;the trainer what was fired for
drinkin’. I hustles over to the tavern an’
finds Jed puttin’ away the juice like he
was loadin’ a train. I gives him a long
talk an’ tells him about the elephants. He
calls ’em his darlings an’ wants to buy
more drink. I begs him to come over an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
help us out, but he’s sore on the Boss an’
won’t make a move. After awhile I gets
him to thinkin’, an’ he sez he’ll do it. Jed
was pretty full an’ was staggerin’, but I
gets him to the lot where ev’ry animal
man in the outfit is a spearin’ them beasts,
while the Boss is cussin’, an’ the whole
town roostin’ on the sidewalk an’ givin’
us the laugh. I gets Jed in an’ right in
front of the Boss.</p>

<p>“The Boss is still sore, and sez, ‘Take
that loafer away.’</p>

<p>“‘Wait,’ sez I.</p>

<p>“Then afore there could be any argument
Jed staggers out in front of the
herd, and, leaning heavy-like on the bale
of hay, begins callin’:</p>

<p>“‘King,’ he yells.</p>

<p>“The biggest bull in the herd lifts his
ear, then holds up his trunk an’ gives a
shriek that scares the crowd white.</p>

<p>“‘Stop that spearin’!’ sez Jed, an’
every animal man gits out of the way.</p>

<p>“‘King!’ yells Jed again, an’ with that
he walks over an’ touches the elephant on
the trunk. The big bull wheels around
and starts away.</p>

<p>“‘Sam, Dick, Boss, Frank!’ keeps yellin’
Jed, an’ the whole herd is turnin’ an’
takin’ the road to the depot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“The crowd on the lot is cheerin’, an’
the animal men walk along by the beasts,
but there’s no more spearin’. Jed jes’
leans against the hay an’ keeps callin’.
He finishes, an’ as the last elephant comes
along he loops down with his trunk, an’
pickin’ Jed up sits him on his trunk an’
walks away proud like jes, as he does in
Ring Three at the finish of the act.</p>

<p>“Say, the Boss is almost wild about it,
an’ the whole town follows the herd to the
train. The Boss had Jed put in the
sleeper, but Jed won’t have it, and crawls
out to sleep in the elephant car, where he
was most at home.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s what I call havin’ a heart.
Them elephants knew that voice. Jed
had been leadin’ ’em up hill and down hill,
from sea to sea, an’ they wasn’t goin’ to
have it any other way.”</p>

<p>“Well, did they take him back for
good?” asked the Saw Dust Spreader.</p>

<p>“Take him back,” said the Concert
Manager. “Well, I should say, an’ the
Boss gives him a gold watch with elephant
engravin’ on it, with a fancy band
with some wordin’ about bein’ a faithful
servant.</p>

<p>“An’, say, Jed was sober after that
durin’ the season, but when we got into
quarters the tavern for Jed all the time.”</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
